  The main focus of our research is using IRT-esque modeling to explore the [White Box Study][wbs] beyond what has already been seen. In this study, latent print examiners use  their expertise to determine whether or not the information contained in two fingerprints (or palm prints) is enough to say that the two prints are a match (from the same person). They do this by looking at corresponding minutae (unique patterns in certain places in the print). However, this conclusion is not objective, yet it is what gets presented at court. The purpose of the White Box Study was to clarify what factors influence sufficiency for individualization (saying that two prints are a match) or an inconclusive decision.
