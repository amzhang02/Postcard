## **Bio**

I am a rising sophomore at Swarthmore College. I am planning to major in Statistics with a minor in Computer Science. Currently, I am doing summer research with Prof. Amanda Luby on fitting Item Response Theory models to forensic data like the White Box Study. Outside of academics, I enjoy running track & field and watching Formula 1.
